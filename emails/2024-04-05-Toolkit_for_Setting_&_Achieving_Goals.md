Goal Setting: 6 Steps to Make the Process Easier and Make You
More Productive
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To begin, you’ll need to pick a goal. That might seem obvious.
But many people fail to achieve their goals. Why? They don’t
spend time defining their specific goal(s). To do so, follow
steps #1-6:

Step 1: Choose a Priority Goal
------------------------------

During goal setting, people often want to overhaul too many
habits at once. For example, start a diet, workout, sleep more
and start meditating. All starting January 1st. Pursuing too many
goals simultaneously often leads to failure of all goals.
Instead, set a priority goal by asking: What is the one goal I
can give the necessary time and energy to pursue right now?

Step 2: Pursue a Lofty Goal
---------------------------

Your chosen goal should be ambitious. Simple goals won’t cause
sufficient levels of neural arousal and stress to stimulate real
growth and learning. Therefore, aim for a lofty goal.

Step 3: Define Specific Actions
-------------------------------

While overarching goals like “get fit,” “write a book” or “run
more” are helpful to list during brainstorming, you must identify
the actions involved in achieving each of these ‘macro’-goals.
Break down your desired outcome into specific actions steps to
significantly improve your likelihood of achieving your goal. For
example, run three times per week.

Step 4: Goal Measurability
--------------------------

Establish a finite time course to complete your goal; I’d suggest
a 12-week time period is appropriate for most goals. Within this
quarterly timeframe, define:

* Total hours per week
* Specific days
* The length of each goal-oriented work session
* A specific time window (e.g., from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m.) or a time
constraint (e.g., before 9 a.m.) for the goal-oriented work
session

Step 5: Quantify Your Goals
---------------------------

Some goals have easily quantifiable outcomes (e.g., running a
marathon in less than a given amount of time). Others are more
subjective (e.g., developing a meditation practice). With loosely
defined goal outcomes, take extra care. Outline the specific,
necessary actions for your plan.

For any type of goal, it can also help to designate smaller
outcomes along the 12-week journey. They will keep you feeling
motivated.

Step 6: Don’t Tell the World!
-----------------------------

Have you ever started a goal and wanted to share this news via
group text or a social media post? Unfortunately, receiving
positive feedback on a newly set goal can undermine your success.
This positive encouragement can activate the brain’s reward
mechanisms. This reduces your motivation to continue pursuing the
goal. You already got the reward without the hard work. So, when
you start a goal, it’s usually best to keep this endeavor to
yourself. It can also make sharing with friends and family more
fun once you’ve hit your first milestone.

----------------------------------------------------------
Goal Pursuit: 7 Tools to Make It Easier and More Effective
----------------------------------------------------------

Once you have specified your goal and outlined the necessary
action steps, use tools #1-7. They will help you to stay
motivated and reach your goal.

Tool 1: The Post-it Note Fallacy
--------------------------------

Placing a note on the mirror that exclaims “floss!” or “run
today!” might be motivating at first, but likely, after a few
days, you fail to “see” this visual reminder anymore. The brain
monitors for anything new in our environment. But it doesn’t call
our attention to the day-to-day similarities. A static visual
reminder will fail to trigger action. Instead, write a new note
every few days and post it in a different location.

Tool 2: Visualize the End and Visualize What Failure Looks Like
---------------------------------------------------------------

Yes failure. If you feel motivated before the work session, spend
one to three minutes visualizing the positive outcomes of goal
success as well as goal failure. Do this to sustain motivation
through your work bout. On unmotivated days, spend one to three
minutes visualizing the failure of not achieving your goal. That
is, visualize the negative outcome. Humans will work very hard to
avoid feelings of failure. This visualization exercise focuses on
feelings of failure. It will recruit neurochemicals, like
adrenaline, to boost your levels of arousal and focus.

Tool 3: Visual Targets
----------------------

Maintaining mental focus is strongly anchored to the visual
system. Use a visual target strategy. Narrow the “cone” of your
visual attention to a specific object or point in front of you.
Hold it in your gaze for 30-90 seconds. Dr. Emily Balcetis (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/k0uld0mwrqb6hdvkxxrcku8x4w577/6qheh8h707q7e9u9/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHViZXJtYW5sYWIuY29tL2VwaXNvZGUvZHItZW1pbHktYmFsY2V0aXMtdG9vbHMtZm9yLXNldHRpbmctYW5kLWFjaGlldmluZy1nb2Fscw==
) and colleagues have shown that this exercise increases
alertness and autonomic arousal in the brain and body. It also
helps to build and sustain motivation.

Tip: Relax your gaze and look off to the horizon when you finish
working. This “turns off” the release of chemicals associated
with alertness and arousal and will aid in relaxation.

Tool 4: Put Your Phone Away!
----------------------------

During your work bouts, put your phone out of reach or turn on
airplane mode. Both task-switching and procrastinating can eat up
your work time. Task-switching is when you look at your phone
between bouts of work. Procrastinating is when you look at your
phone right before starting the work.

Tool 5: Intermittent Rewards
----------------------------

Motivation and the associated neurochemical dopamine have been
the topic (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/k0uld0mwrqb6hdvkxxrcku8x4w577/kkhmh6hl4l7lvosk/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHViZXJtYW5sYWIuY29tL3RvcGljcy9hZGhkLWRyaXZlLWFuZC1tb3RpdmF0aW9u
) of many Huberman Lab episodes. In brief, consistently receiving
rewards diminishes the reward’s power and reduces overall
motivation. In contrast, only rewarding yourself at the finish
line (~12 weeks) also reduces motivation.

The solution? Use random, intermittent rewards (like a slot
machine) to maintain motivation. After your goal work, flip a
coin: heads = reward vs. tails = no reward.

On a reward day, try using positive self-talk. Do it for 30-60
seconds to reinforce the neural circuits associated with internal
motivation. Treat yourself to a physical reward from time to
time. For example, watch a movie or eat a food you enjoy!

Tool 6: The Middle Problem
--------------------------

People tend to be highly motivated to start and finish a goal.
But motivation often declines in the middle. To overcome the
middle problem:

* Acknowledge this is a normal phenomenon
* Use time chunking to break-up the middle portion into 3-4
smaller time segments

Tool 7: Circadian Rhythms & Attention
-------------------------------------

There are specific times during the day that are for optimal goal
work. Dr. Pablo Valdez describes (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/k0uld0mwrqb6hdvkxxrcku8x4w577/25h2hoh2n252w5c8/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmNiaS5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi9wbWMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvUE1DNjQzMDE3Mi8=
) three peak times each day when our attention and focus are at
their highest. As a rough guide, 30 minutes, 3 hours, and 11
hours after you wake up are great times for hard work. This
happens because of the body’s circadian rhythm (sleep-wake cycle)
and rhythmicity of body temperature and associated
neurochemicals.
